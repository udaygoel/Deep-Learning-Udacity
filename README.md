# Deep-Learning-Udacity

Here you can find several projects covering various neural network architectures for deep learning applications. These projects were developed as part of the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). 



## Projects

You can view and launch the following projects:

- [Sentiment Classification using Feed Forward Networks](https://github.com/udaygoel/Deep-Learning-Udacity/tree/master/Sentiment%20Classification%20using%20Feed%20Forward%20Networks)

  This project develops a sentiment classification model using Feed Forward Networks. The Project mimics the lesson in the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) and runs through each step in detail. The model is trained on movie reviews and is able to achieve more than 80% accuracy.

- [Prosper-Loan-Data-Exploration](https://github.com/udaygoel/Data-Analyst-Udacity/tree/master/Prosper-Loan-Data-Exploration)

  This project covers the exploration of almost 114,000 loans with 81 variables from peer-to-peer lending firm Prosper. The objective is to conduct univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis using several features to identify their relationship to the pricing of loans. The features can be taken directly from the dataset or engineered by running mathematical operations on a single or multiple features provided.  This project has been implemented in R.

- [Prosper-Loan-Data-Visualization](https://github.com/udaygoel/Data-Analyst-Udacity/tree/master/Prosper-Loan-Data-Visualization)

  This project uses Prosper-Loan-Data-Exploration analysis results to create visualizations in order to present insights from data. The visualization is created using D3.js and HTML and presents an animation and an interactive feature.
