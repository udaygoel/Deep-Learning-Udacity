# Deep-Learning-Udacity

Here you can find several projects covering various neural network architectures for deep learning applications. These projects were developed as part of the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). 



## Projects

You can view and launch the following projects:

- [Sentiment Classification using Feed Forward Networks](https://github.com/udaygoel/Deep-Learning-Udacity/tree/master/Sentiment%20Classification%20using%20Feed%20Forward%20Networks)

  This project develops a sentiment classification model using Feed Forward Networks. The Project mimics the lesson in the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) and runs through each step in detail. The model is trained on movie reviews and is able to achieve more than 80% accuracy.

- [Dog Breed Classifier - Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/udaygoel/Deep-Learning-Udacity/tree/master/Dog%20Breed%20Classifier%20-%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks)

  This project develops a classifier to identify the dog breed using Convolutional Neural Networks. The network architecture applies transfer learning and uses the bottleneck features from Resnet 50 architecture in Keras to develop the classifier model. There are 133 dog breeds with 6680 training images, 835 validation images and 836 testing images. The project also uses the human face detection tool from OpenCV. Towards the end the classifier is run on a series of pictures collected from internet and identifies the breed of the dog.

- [Prosper-Loan-Data-Visualization](https://github.com/udaygoel/Data-Analyst-Udacity/tree/master/Prosper-Loan-Data-Visualization)

  This project uses Prosper-Loan-Data-Exploration analysis results to create visualizations in order to present insights from data. The visualization is created using D3.js and HTML and presents an animation and an interactive feature.
